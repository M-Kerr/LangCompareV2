Goal
----
An application to compare the runtime of similar code constructs in
multiple languages.

Why
---
The difference between languages in runtime efficiency is an occasional
topic of conversation amongst developers.
This application will allow the user to test and compare the runtime 
efficiency of code written in multiple languages.

How
---
The user provides code files of the languages of their choice. The 
application will compile (if necessary) then run the files in a subprocess, 
using a wrapper that times how long it takes for the code to complete. The
wrapper then returns the results back to the application for comparison.

Current program structure
-------------------------
The main application is currently built in C++, using Qt.
The "code/<language_name>/" subdirectories contain user submitted code 
files. Inside the code/ directory is a collection of wrapper files for each
supported language. The job of the wrapper file is to load the user code,
initialize a timer, execute the user code, and relay the timing results
back to the application (currently via pipe, will refactor to sockets soon
for cross platform compatibility).


Detailed program structure
--------------------------
**src/languages/code.h**
    User submitted code files are abstracted into a ``Code`` object 
    containing the language, file information, and timing results.
    A ``Code`` subclass is created for each language, where the language's
    specific build and run rules are implemented within the Code.execute()
    method. The Code.execute() method should ultimately run the language's
    wrapper file, passing the user code to the wrapper file.

    The ``Code`` object contains a ``Results`` object member, which stores 
    the benchmarking results.
    
    Example ``Code`` subclasses:
    
    - *src/languages/code_cpp.h*
    - *src/languages/code_python.h* 


**src/languages/languages.h**
    Root languages header, contains the factory function called within main
    to build Code objects.


**code/<language>/<user_code>**
    User-submitted code files are expected to have an execute() function 
    that calls the code to benchmark.


**code/wrapper.<language_extension>**
    Through either a macro or command line argument, the wrapper file for
    each language receives the code to wrap; a write pipe file descriptor;
    and optionally receives the number of iterations to execute; and a 
    timeout (seconds) to stop execution upon expiration.

    The wrapper file is expected to:

    - Embed the user code
    - Initialize a timer
        - The timer should begin execution as close as possible to the 
          execute() call, and stop upon its return
    - Call the execute() function
    - Stop the timer
    - Average the timing results of the execute() iterations
    - Return the results through the write pipe
    

**src/main.cpp**
    The main call first builds a list of Code objects through user input.
    Then it opens a pipe, calls each Code object's execute() method,  
    passing the pipe file descriptor as an argument in order to communicate
    the timing results. Finally, it prints each Code object's results.


How to contribute support for a language
----------------------------------------
    
1. Build a wrapper file that matches the requirements for wrapper files
   described in the "Detailed program structure" section.
   *Use the existing wrapper files for inspiration.*

   A const string containing the path to this wrapper file should be placed
   at the top of the header file to the Code subclass created in step 3.

.. code-block:: c++

   static const QString <LANGUAGE>_WRAPPER_FILE("code/wrapper.<extension>");


2. Create a user-code directory for the language within the ``code/`` 
   directory. E.g., ``code/cpp/``. This is the directory the user places the 
   code they want to benchmark.

3. Create a ``Code`` subclass using the file naming convention
    - ``code_<language>.h`` 
   and class naming convention:
    - ``<Code_Language_Name>``


Code subclass design
++++++++++++++++++++
**Constructor**

Pass the name of the language into the ``Code`` superclass constructor, and
prefix the user-code path for the language to the ``file_name`` argument.
Forward the remaining arguments to the ``Code`` constructor.

.. code-block:: c++

   Code_Cpp::Code_Cpp(const QString file_name,
                      QObject *parent, unsigned iters, unsigned limit)
       : Code("C++", "code/cpp/" + file_name, parent, iters, limit){}
        
**Implement the virtual execute method**

.. code-block:: c++

   bool execute(int read_fd, int write_fd) override;

The ``execute`` method should compile the language's ``wrapper.<ext>`` and user
code together then run it, passing the required command line arguments and any
others if necessary.
Execution must support the user adding a single file directly in the 
``code/<language>/`` directory, or multiple files within a package.

Finally, ``execute`` should call ``this->results.receive(read_fd)`` 
to receive the benchmark results, before returning successfully.

Code sublass examples
    - ``code_cpp.cpp`` 
    - ``code_python.cpp``


TODO
----

A pipe is used to communicate when running instead of connecting stdin/stdout 
in the event that the user code is timing IO operations.

#. Inside /src/languages/languages.h:
     - #include the code_<language>.h header file
     - Add the language name to the LANGUAGES QStringList
     - Add an ``else if`` segment to the ``code_factory`` function,
       building and returning a pointer to a ``Code_<Language>`` object.
       The segment should follow this basic pattern:

.. code-block:: c++

   // <Language>
   else if (language.toLower() == "<language>")
   {
       auto code = new Code_<Language>(file_name, parent);
       auto file = code->get_file();
       if (file.exists())
       {
           return code;
       }
       else
       {
           delete code;
           return nullptr;
       }
       QFileInfo file("code/<language_abbreviation>/" + file_name);
       if (file.exists())
       {
           return new Code_<Language>(file, parent);
       }
       else
       {
           return nullptr;
       }

    
#. Add a code/<language_abbreviation> directory and an example hello_world
    user file that prints the string "Hello, World!" within an execute()
    function.

#. Build and run the application, testing your language's hello_world;
    code.
            

How to contribute common algorithms, data structures, and constructs
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For common algorithms and data structures, add them as:
::

    code/algorithms/<algorithm>/<algorithm>.<extension>
    code/data_structures/<data_structure>/<data_structure>.<extension>

If adding a new algorithm or data structure, include a README outlining 
the parameters of the algorithm or structure.
For an example, see the code/algorithms/mergesorts/mergesort directory.

Constructs should follow the same pattern, where constructs are other
common code constructs that don't fall cleanly within the categories of
algorithms or data structures. E.g., design patterns, simple servers,
memory operations (garbage collection, memory pools, etc.).
